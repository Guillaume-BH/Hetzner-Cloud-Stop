# Reloaded-MC Hetzner Stop

This is a plugin to stop your Hetzner instance when the server is stopping.

## Configuration

To use this plugin, you need to edit the `config.yml` file in the plugin folder.

Replace those values with your own in the `config.yml` file:
- The `HETZNER_API_KEY` is your Hetzner API key.

Here is an example of how your `config.yml` file should look:

```yaml
HETZNER_API_TOKEN: "YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE"
```
